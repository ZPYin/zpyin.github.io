A new shipborne Sun–sky–lunar photometer was validated through comparisons with collocated MICROTOPS II and multiwavelength Raman polarization lidar measurements during two trans-Atlantic cruises. A full diurnal cycle of mixed-dust smoke episode was captured by both the shipborne photometer and lidar. The coefficient of determination for the linear regression between MICROTOPS II and the shipborne photometer was 0.993 for AOD at 500?nm based on the entire dataset.
