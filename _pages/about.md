### My background

I'm a PhD student at Wuhan University, working on Space Physics. My research interests included the aspects as listed below:

- multiwavelength Raman polarization lidar
- lidar calibration
- multiple scattering modeling
- aerosol-cloud interactions in mixed-phased clouds

I've co-developed a mobile 532 nm polarization Raman lidar aimed at marine aerosol measurements and investigated the effects of multiple scattering from dense liquid clouds on polarization lidar measurements. I once joined the design of a 355 nm rotational Raman lidar with capabilities of full-day temperature measurements. In the project, I helped optimize the parameters of the central wavelength and bandwidth of the narrow-band filters and evaluated the performance of the lidar by comparing with the collocated radiosonde measurements and re-analysis meteorological data.

I co-developed an automatic lidar data processing platform, which can output the extensive products of aerosol distribution and intensive products which indicate the particle shape and particle size. All the products were displayed in the [PollyNET website](#1) with an delay less than 1 hour.
